The city of New York was bustling with excitement as the sun began to rise over the skyline. In one small corner of the metropolis, a young journalist-to-be was about to embark on the biggest adventure of her life.$

Fresh out of Harvard and armed with a passion for storytelling, she had been tirelessly searching for the perfect job, hoping to make a name for herself in the competitive world of journalism. After two long months of sending out resumes and letters, her determination had finally paid off. She had landed a position at the most prestigious newspaper in the city.$

As the first light of day began to filter through her window, Excitement and nervousness coursed through her veins as she woke up early in the morning to prepare for her first day at work. She took a long shower, letting the hot water wash away any traces of sleepiness. As she dressed, she carefully selected each item of clothing, making sure that every detail was perfect. She wanted to make a good impression on her first day.$

As she stepped out of her apartment, the city greeted her with its usual cacophony of sounds and smells. Horns honked, sirens blared, and the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air. Samantha made her way to the subway station, her heart racing with anticipation.$

As she boarded the train, she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to see an elderly woman smiling warmly at her. "Good luck on your first day, dear," the woman said before disappearing into the crowd. Samantha couldn't help but smile. It was moments like these that reminded her why she had chosen this path.$

As the train pulled into the station, Samantha stepped out onto the platform, her eyes scanning the crowd for any sign of the newspaper's building. She starts walking in the direction of her work place. She then noticed a strange man following her.  As Samantha noticed the strange man following her, her heart began to race.She quickened her pace and tried to lose him in the crowd, but he persisted. She was a seasoned journalist, but the man's persistence was making her uneasy. Her mind raced with possibilities: Was he a stalker? Was he following her for the story? Or was he just lost?$

Samantha decided to confront the man, hoping to diffuse the situation. 
Samantha: "Excuse me, sir." Turning to face him.
Samantha: "Is there something you need?"$

The man hesitated for a moment before replying.
Stranger: "I'm sorry, miss. I didn't mean to startle you. I was just trying to find my way to the subway."$

Samantha breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that her fears had been unfounded. 
Samantha: "No problem." Replied with a smile. 
Samantha: "The subway is just a few blocks that way. I can show you the way if you'd like."$

The man nodded gratefully, and Samantha began to lead him through the crowded streets of New York. As they walked, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She kept glancing over her shoulder, trying to see if they were being followed.$

Suddenly, there was a loud crack, and Samantha felt a searing pain in the back of her head. She stumbled forward, her vision blurring, and fell to the ground.The last thing she saw was the man's face, twisted into a cruel smirk. And then everything went dark.$

Samantha woke up in a dark room, her head pounding. She tried to sit up, but found that she was bound to a chair. Her eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light, and she realized that she was not alone.$

In the corner of the room, a man was sitting in a chair, his face obscured by shadows. He spoke in a gravelly voice.$

Man: "You shouldn't have poked your nose where it didn't belong, Miss Samantha. My employer doesn't appreciate nosy journalists."$
Man: "Welcome to your new reality, Miss Samantha," he said in a deep, menacing voice. "You see, I work for a man who has a vested interest in keeping you from pursuing your latest assignment. And he's willing to go to great lengths to make sure you don't get in his way."$

Samantha's heart sank as she realized who the man was referring to: John Wick, the ruthless businessman who controlled much of the city's underworld. She had been assigned to investigate him, but had never imagined that he would go to such lengths to silence her.$

Within the next few seconds, Wick enters the room, the man behind her kidnap.  Barely conscious, she heard Wick's voice say

Wick: "Well, it seems that Miss Samantha is quite resilient. But I have a proposition for you, my dear."$

Samantha groaned, struggling to keep her eyes open. 
Samantha: "What kind of proposition?" Her voice barely above a whisper.
Wick leaned in closer, his eyes glittering in the dim light.
Wick: "You can go home, Samantha. We'll even pay for your medical bills. But on one condition: you quit your job and forget all about this investigation.$

Samantha's mind raced as she weighed her options. She could go home and recover from the nightmare that she had just experienced, or she could continue pursuing the case and put Wick behind bars.$

But the more she thought about it, the more she realized that going after Wick was a dangerous game. She had already narrowly escaped with her life once - who was to say that she wouldn't be killed the next time around?$

Samantha took a deep breath and looked Wick in the eye. 
Samantha: "I'll take the deal." Her voice is steady. 
Samantha: "But I'm not going to forget about this. I'll find another way to take you down."$

Wick chuckled, a cold sound that made Samantha's blood run cold. 
Wick: "You journalists are all the same." Standing up. 
Wick: "Always chasing after the next big story. Well, I'll be waiting for you, Samantha. And when you come back, I'll be ready."$

Samantha was escorted out of the dark room and taken to the hospital, where she received treatment for her injuries. She was discharged a few days later and given a substantial sum of money to cover her medical bills and start a new life.$

As she left the hospital, Samantha knew that she had a choice to make. She could go back to her old life and continue investigating Wick, or she could abandon everything and travel to a new city to start a new life.@

Samantha couldn't bring herself to abandon the investigation. She knew that it wouldn't be easy, but she couldn't let him get away with what he had done to her. She went back to her office and started pouring over the case files, looking for leads that she could follow to finally put Wick behind bars.$

As she was reading through the files, a knock on her door interrupted her thoughts. Samantha: "Come in." Looking up from her desk.$

In walked a young man, dressed in a smart suit and carrying a file in his hand. 
Man: "Hi, I'm Addo." Offering his hand.
Addo: "I've been assigned to assist you with the case."$

Samantha shook his hand, sizing him up. He seemed eager and intelligent, but she had worked alone for so long that she wasn't sure how she felt about having a partner.$

Samantha: "Thanks for coming." Gesturing for him to take a seat.
Samantha: "I'm Samantha. So, what have you found out about Wick so far?"$

Addo opened his file and started to give her a rundown of what he had discovered. As he spoke, Samantha felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe with his help, they could finally bring Wick to justice.$

Over the next few weeks, Samantha and Addo worked tirelessly on the case, following leads and gathering evidence. They interviewed witnesses, dug through financial records, and staked out known Wick associates.$

As they worked, they developed a camaraderie that surprised Samantha. She had never worked so closely with someone before, and it was refreshing to have someone to bounce ideas off of.$

One evening, after a long day of investigating, they sat in Samantha's office, going over their notes. 
Addo: "You know," looking up at her. "I have to admit, I was a little intimidated when I first met you. I've heard stories about your work and I wasn't sure if I could keep up."$

Samantha smiled wryly.
Samantha: "Well, you seem to be doing just fine."$

Addo grinned.
Addo: "Thanks. But seriously, I'm glad we're working together. I think we make a pretty good team."$

Samantha nodded, feeling a sense of satisfaction. Maybe this was what she needed to finally bring Wick down$

As Samantha and Addo continued to work together, their bond grew stronger by the day. They shared a deep trust and respect for one another, and Samantha felt grateful to have such a valuable partner by her side.$

But unbeknownst to Samantha, Addo had a secret. He was actually a spy for Wick, sent to lure Samantha into a trap that would ultimately lead to her assassination.$

Addo had been feeding information back to Wick about Samantha's movements and progress on the case, and Wick had been patiently waiting for the right moment to strike.$

One day, Addo called Samantha with a tip-off. He claimed that he had gotten wind of a secret meeting between Wick and one of his associates at a shady location, where they would be conducting a drug deal.$

Samantha knew that this was a crucial opportunity to gather evidence against Wick, and she needed to act fast. She had a choice to make: should she take a cab, which would get her to the location quickly but might put her in danger if she was being followed, or take a train, which would take longer but be less conspicuous?$

Samantha's heart pounded in her chest as she weighed her options. She couldn't shake of the sense of a bad feeling that some misfortune awaits her. But she also couldn't ignore the lead he had given her about the drug deal. It could be the break she needed to finally bring Wick to justice.@

Samantha decided to take the train, hoping to avoid any potential danger. As she settled into her seat, exhaustion overtook her, and she soon fell into a deep sleep.$

In her sleep, Samantha had a vivid dream about Addo setting her up and getting her killed. She was shaken when she woke up, unsure if the dream was just a manifestation of her fears or a premonition of what was to come.$

Samantha had a choice to make. Should she believe in the dream and stay away from the meeting spot, potentially missing out on a crucial opportunity to gather evidence against Wick? Or should she push forward and trust that her dream was just a product of her imagination?$

After much contemplation, Samantha decided to believe in her dream. She called the police for backup and went to the meeting spot undercover, hoping to confirm her suspicions.$

As she got closer to the location, Samantha kept a watchful eye out for any signs of danger. She hid behind a nearby dustbin and listened in on a conversation between Addo and Wick.$

She then begins to gather a thought of calling the police immediately.
But she is stuck in her thought and doesn’t know what to do.@

Samantha: Lemme just be quiet and wait for backup. In her thought.
As Samantha hid behind the bin, her heart was racing. Suddenly, her phone rang loudly, causing her to curse under her breath. She cursed herself for forgetting to put it on silent mode. Wick and Addo immediately spotted her and started closing in.

Samantha felt a knot form in her stomach as Wick's words sunk in. 
Wick: "You thought you were so clever, didn't you?" he sneered. "But you've finally led yourself right into my trap."

She looked around at the men surrounding her, knowing that escape was impossible. But she refused to give Wick the satisfaction of seeing her cower in fear.

She is then drawn into the thought of pulling the little gun she had on her.@

She decides to refrain from that Idea.
 Samantha: "You can try to intimidate me all you want, but I won't back down," she said, standing tall.$

Wick chuckled.
Wick: "I admire your bravery, Samantha. But unfortunately for you, it's too little, too late. You've already sealed your fate."$

Samantha felt a glimmer of hope as she heard sirens in the distance. She knew that the police were on their way. But Wick seemed unfazed and simply gestured for his men to take her away.$

As they dragged her towards a waiting car, Addo looked at her apologetically. "I'm sorry, Samantha," he said softly. "I had no choice."$

Samantha felt a surge of anger and betrayal. 
Samantha: "You were working with Wick this whole time?" she spat.$

Addo nodded. "I'm sorry. He promised me money, power...I couldn't resist."$

Samantha shook her head in disbelief.
Samantha: "You'll regret this," she said, as the car door slammed shut behind her.$

As they drove towards an unknown destination, Samantha tried to think of a way out. But the car was heavily guarded, and she was still recovering from her injuries.$

But just as she was about to lose hope, she heard the sound of gunfire outside. The car screeched to a halt, and she heard the familiar sound of police sirens.$

The door was flung open, and she saw a team of heavily armed officers standing outside. "Are you alright?" one of them asked, helping her out of the car.$

Samantha nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. "I am now," she said.$

As Samantha was taken to safety, she couldn't help but feel relieved that it was finally over. She had taken a risk by not quitting her job, but it had paid off in the end. Samantha made headlines on the News and was later given an award for her bravery and for pursuing justice. She was granted a promotion and continued to work on cases that helped make New York City a safer place.$
